# Global Cline Rules

## 1. General Workflow
- Think step-by-step; ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous.
- Summarize plan before making changes; await approval on complex edits.

## 2. Response & Diff Formatting
- Use Markdown; wrap code in triple backticks with language tags.
- Present file modifications in Unified Diff (patch) format.
- Include a Conventional Commitâ€“style message for each commit.

## 3. Documentation Practices
- Update `README.md` with any new setup or feature instructions.

## 4. Testing Standards
- Provide at least one unit test per new feature.
- Name tests to reflect behavior.

## 6. Error Handling & Logging
- Handle errors gracefully, logging only essential details.
- Use unique error codes or identifiers for easier debugging.
