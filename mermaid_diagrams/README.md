# Mermaid Diagrams

This folder contains examples of using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) to create diagrams for notional Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) architectures and related workflows. These examples demonstrate how to visually represent complex systems and processes using Mermaid's syntax.

## Examples

### 1. **Cloud Foundry PaaS on AWS**
   - A diagram illustrating the architecture of a Cloud Foundry-based PaaS deployed on AWS.
   - This example highlights the key components and their relationships within the PaaS environment.

### 2. **User Request Flow in a Multi-Partition Application**
   - Two optional paths for user requests to flow in an application built across AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud partitions.
   - These diagrams show how requests are routed and processed in a multi-partition setup.

### 3. **Mermaid-Based Menu**
   - An example of creating a menu using Mermaid's `click` directive to link to other diagrams or resources.
   - **Note**: The `click` directive does not work in GitHub's Mermaid preview. To view this menu with full functionality, use the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/) or host it in an environment that supports interactive Mermaid features.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
```
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/example-projects.git
```
2. Navigate to the mermaid_diagrams folder:

3. Open the .mmd files in a text editor or use the Mermaid Live Editor to render the diagrams.
